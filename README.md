# Mainframe_Classwork_Example_1

This was an assignment for my mainframe programming class. The object was to take in data on various orchestras within a mutual fund account, while taking in transaction requests from a file and outputing the results. 

The Assignment_8.txt file shows the COBOL code along with the proper JCL being run on the mainframe with the generated output at the end.
